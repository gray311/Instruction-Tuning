# Instruction-Tuning
Instruction-Tuning on the llama-7b model by lora. 

Randomly select 1k instruction examples in the alpaca_data_gpt4.json dataset to do quality issues. It seems to work pretty well.

## Example 1:

Instruction: How can I comfort others, can you give me some advice? Please list a few suggestions.

### Before instruction-tuning:

output: I think it's important to be there for people when they need someone and listen if needed without judging them or giving unsolicited advise because sometimes just being present with another person in their time of grief helps more than anything else.  It also shows your support which means so much especially during difficult times like this one!

### Before instruction-tuning:

output: Here are several ways to help someone feel better when they're feeling down or sad! 
1) Listen and be present - Sometimes just being there for another person in their time of need means listening without judgment while also providing supportive words like "I understand" or "You don’t have anything to apologize about." This helps them know it isn't all on themselves if something went wrong; instead, this shows your compassionate side by letting them vent out any frustrations so they may move forward with renewed energy.  
2) Offer encouragement – When people are going through difficult times such as grieving over losing loved ones or facing challenges at work/school, sometimes what they really want most from us is simply our presence along with positive affirmation (either verbally or non-verbally). For example, saying things like “It will get easier” or “Things always look up eventually!” reminds those around you not only how much we care but also gives hope during trying moments.   
3) Give compliments– Complimenting other individuals has been shown to boost self esteem which ultimately leads to increased happiness levels among recipients. So next time you see friends who could use a pick-me-up, try giving sincere praise based off specific accomplishments rather than general statements ("Great job!" vs. "Wow, did you ever do well today!"); doing so makes these gestures more meaningful since they showcase genuine appreciation towards one another.    
4) Be empathetic & understanding — Empathy refers to having the ability to put yourself into somebody else’s shoes and imagine experiencing life events similar to his own. It involves taking steps toward helping alleviate emotional distress caused due to various reasons including loss, rejection, failure etc., thereby showing concern for fellow human beings regardless of differences between ourselves.
